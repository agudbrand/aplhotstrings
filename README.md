AutoHotkey script for TryAPL ASCII symbol composition anywhere.

This script uses AutoHotkey, which is avaliable [here](https://www.autohotkey.com/).
AutoHotkey is only avaliable for Windows, so this script will not work on other platforms.

To use the script, download AutoHotkey and the script, then double click on the script file. It should begin running immediately, and you should see a green square with an H in it in your taskbar's tray. To stop the script, right click the icon in your tray and stop it.

Now you can use compositions anywhere. For example, type "<-" and then press tab.
